# Drowsiness-and-Yawning-Detection using Image Processing
This project aims to detect and predict "Drowsiness" and "Yawning" through image processing.68 (x,y) landmarks are determined and predicted with the help of OpenCV and dlib .Eye Aspect Ratio(EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio(MAR) are calculated and compared with the threshold value to determine drowsy and yawning condition.An alarm alerting system is also implemented with the help of "espeak" module.
